Bayes' Theorem helps us **update probabilities** when we get new information. It’s super useful in data science, medical testing, spam filtering, and many other areas.

### Formula:
If \( B \) is an event that affects \( A \), Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(B | A) = \frac{P(A | B) P(B)}{P(A)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(B | A) \) = Probability of **B happening given A happened** (this is what we’re trying to find).
- \( P(A | B) \) = Probability of **A happening given B happened**.
- \( P(B) \) = Probability of **B happening** (prior probability).
- \( P(A) \) = Total probability of **A happening**, which can be found using the **Law of Total Probability**.

---

### Example:
Let’s say there’s a **disease** that affects 1% of a population (\( P(D) = 0.01 \)).

A test exists for this disease:
- If someone **has** the disease, the test correctly detects it **90%** of the time (\( P(T | D) = 0.9 \)).
- If someone **does not** have the disease, the test **incorrectly** gives a positive result **5%** of the time (\( P(T | \neg D) = 0.05 \)).

Now, if you **test positive**, what’s the probability that you **actually have the disease** (\( P(D | T) \))?

#### Step 1: Use Bayes' Theorem
\[
P(D | T) = \frac{P(T | D) P(D)}{P(T)}
\]

#### Step 2: Find \( P(T) \) (Total Probability of Testing Positive)
Using the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(T) = P(T | D) P(D) + P(T | \neg D) P(\neg D)
\]

\[
P(T) = (0.9 \times 0.01) + (0.05 \times 0.99)
\]

\[
P(T) = 0.009 + 0.0495 = 0.0585
\]

#### Step 3: Plug Values into Bayes’ Formula

\[
P(D | T) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.01}{0.0585}
\]

\[
P(D | T) = \frac{0.009}{0.0585} \approx 0.154
\]

So, even if you test positive, there’s only a **15.4% chance** that you actually have the disease!

### Why is This Important?
- It shows how **false positives** impact real-world probability.
- It’s used in spam detection, medical tests, and even AI.
