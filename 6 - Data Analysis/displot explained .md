Good question, bro! The **y-axis in a distribution plot (distplot)** doesnâ€™t show actual values like in a scatter plot. Instead, it shows the **density (proportion of data points at each charge level)**.

### **How the y-axis works in `sns.distplot()`**

-   The x-axis is **charges** (actual or predicted medical costs).
-   The y-axis is the **probability density**, meaning **how common a specific charge range is**.

### **Why?**

Instead of counting raw values (like a histogram), it **normalizes** them so the total area under the curve is **1** (100%). This helps compare distributions even if they have different scales.

### **Example Interpretation:**

-   A **high peak** means many people have charges in that range.
-   If the **blue (predicted) and red (actual) lines overlap**, it means the model predicts well.
-   If they are **far apart**, the model is not capturing the real trend correctly.

### **Final Answer:**

The **y-axis is the proportion (density) of occurrences of a charge value**, not actual count. It helps see **how common certain charges are** in the dataset. ðŸš€
