The **Law of Total Probability** helps you calculate the probability of an event by considering different ways that event can happen.

### Basic Idea:
If you have a set of **mutually exclusive** and **exhaustive** events (meaning they cover all possible outcomes), you can break down the probability of another event using those.

### Formula:
If \( B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n \) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, then for any event \( A \):

\[
P(A) = P(A | B_1) P(B_1) + P(A | B_2) P(B_2) + \dots + P(A | B_n) P(B_n)
\]

or in summation form:

\[
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A | B_i) P(B_i)
\]

### Example:
Suppose a company has **two factories**, and they produce widgets:

- Factory **X** produces **60%** of the widgets (\( P(X) = 0.6 \)).
- Factory **Y** produces **40%** of the widgets (\( P(Y) = 0.4 \)).
- Defective rates:
  - Factory X has **5%** defect rate (\( P(D | X) = 0.05 \)).
  - Factory Y has **10%** defect rate (\( P(D | Y) = 0.10 \)).

Now, whatâ€™s the **total probability** that a randomly selected widget is defective (\( P(D) \))?

Using the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(D) = P(D | X) P(X) + P(D | Y) P(Y)
\]

\[
P(D) = (0.05 \times 0.6) + (0.10 \times 0.4)
\]

\[
P(D) = 0.03 + 0.04 = 0.07
\]

So, the probability that a randomly chosen widget is defective is **7%**.

Does this explanation help?
