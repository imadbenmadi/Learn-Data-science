While Sequelize is primarily built to **interact with the database**, it doesn't directly support creating stored procedures, events, or views in the same way that raw SQL does. However, you can still **execute raw SQL** through Sequelize, even to create those things. Sequelize does not **natively** have a method for creating or managing these database objects, but you can still **use Sequelize's `query()` method** to execute these DDL (Data Definition Language) statements.

### **Solution**: You can use **Sequelize's `query()`** to **create** stored procedures, events, and views, just like how you'd execute any raw SQL.

Here’s how to **create and call them** using **Sequelize ORM**:

---

### 1. **Creating a Stored Procedure using Sequelize**

You’ll still need to write the SQL to create a stored procedure, but you **execute** it using `sequelize.query()`:

#### **Creating Stored Procedure with Sequelize**:

```javascript
const { sequelize } = require("./models"); // Import your Sequelize instance

const createProcedure = async () => {
    await sequelize.query(`
    CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeSalary(IN emp_id INT)
    BEGIN
      SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY, MAX_SALARY
      FROM EMPLOYEES
      WHERE EMP_ID = emp_id;
    END;
  `);
    console.log("Stored Procedure Created!");
};

createProcedure(); // Call this function to create the procedure
```

#### **Calling the Stored Procedure**:

```javascript
const callProcedure = async (empId) => {
    const result = await sequelize.query("CALL GetEmployeeSalary(:empId)", {
        replacements: { empId }, // Parameterized query
        type: sequelize.QueryTypes.RAW, // Raw query execution
    });
    console.log(result); // Log the result from the procedure
};

callProcedure(101); // Example call to the procedure
```

---

### 2. **Creating an Event using Sequelize**

You can create an **event** using raw SQL with Sequelize like this:

#### **Creating an Event with Sequelize**:

```javascript
const createEvent = async () => {
    await sequelize.query(`
    CREATE EVENT SalaryUpdateEvent
    ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
    STARTS '2025-01-01 00:00:00'
    DO
      UPDATE EMPLOYEES SET MIN_SALARY = MIN_SALARY + 100;
  `);
    console.log("Event Created!");
};

createEvent(); // Call this function to create the event
```

#### **Enabling/Disabling the Event** (Sequelize will handle this too):

```javascript
// Disable the event
await sequelize.query("ALTER EVENT SalaryUpdateEvent DISABLE;");

// Enable the event
await sequelize.query("ALTER EVENT SalaryUpdateEvent ENABLE;");
```

---

### 3. **Creating a View using Sequelize**

Finally, creating a **view** using Sequelize can also be done with raw SQL:

#### **Creating a View with Sequelize**:

```javascript
const createView = async () => {
    await sequelize.query(`
    CREATE VIEW EmployeeSalaryView AS
    SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY, MAX_SALARY
    FROM EMPLOYEES;
  `);
    console.log("View Created!");
};

createView(); // Call this function to create the view
```

#### **Querying the View with Sequelize**:

```javascript
const getEmployeeSalaries = async () => {
    const result = await sequelize.query("SELECT * FROM EmployeeSalaryView", {
        type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT, // Result as an array of rows
    });
    console.log(result); // Log the data from the view
};

getEmployeeSalaries();
```

---

### **Why Sequelize Doesn't Have Built-in Methods for This**

Sequelize is an **ORM** focused on **data management** and **query building** rather than full database schema management. So while you can **query** your database using Sequelize, creating or managing **schema objects** (like views, stored procedures, or events) is typically done through **raw SQL** because these features are more tightly coupled to the database's internal mechanics.

---

### **TL;DR**:

You **cannot directly create stored procedures, events, or views using Sequelize ORM methods** alone. But you can **use `sequelize.query()`** to execute raw SQL that creates and interacts with these objects. This way, you can manage them in your app just like normal SQL operations!

Let me know if that clears things up!
