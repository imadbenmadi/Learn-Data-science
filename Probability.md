### **1. Probability Distributions (Essential for Data Science)**  
- **Discrete Distributions** (countable outcomes):
  - **Bernoulli**: Binary outcome (0 or 1).  
  - **Binomial**: Multiple trials with two outcomes (success/failure).  
  - **Poisson**: Count events in a fixed interval (e.g., number of website visits per hour).  

- **Continuous Distributions** (infinite possible values):  
  - **Uniform**: Equal probability for all values in a range.  
  - **Normal (Gaussian)**: Bell-shaped curve, used in statistics and ML models.  
  - **Exponential**: Models time until an event happens (e.g., time between customer arrivals).  


### **2. Law of Large Numbers & Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**  
- **Law of Large Numbers**: As sample size increases, the sample mean approaches the true mean.  
- **CLT**: No matter the original distribution, if you take large enough samples, the mean follows a normal distribution.  

### **3. Real-World Applications in Data Science**  
- **A/B Testing**: Using probability to test changes in products/websites.  
- **Machine Learning**: Probabilistic models (e.g., Na√Øve Bayes, Hidden Markov Models).  
- **Risk Analysis & Decision Making**: Predicting future trends using probability.
