The correct answer is:

**To look at the distribution of your residuals in a multiple linear regression.**

A histogram of the residuals (the differences between the predicted and actual values) is useful in regression analysis because it helps you assess whether the residuals follow a normal distribution. This assumption is important for many statistical tests and model diagnostics in multiple linear regression. By visualizing the residuals' distribution, you can:

1. **Check for bias**: If the residuals are not symmetrically distributed around zero, it could indicate a bias in the model.
2. **Identify non-linearity**: If the histogram shows skewness or irregular patterns, it might suggest that your model is not capturing some aspect of the data (like non-linearity) properly.
3. **Evaluate homoscedasticity**: You can also check if the residuals' variance is constant across all levels of the independent variables (a key assumption in linear regression).

So, the histogram allows you to assess the underlying assumptions and the overall fit of your model.
