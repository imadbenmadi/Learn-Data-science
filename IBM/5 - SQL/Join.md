Got it! Let's break it down step by step.

## **What Are Joins in SQL?**  
A **JOIN** in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.  

There are two ways to perform joins:  
1. **Implicit Join** (Old Style) ‚Üí Uses `WHERE` to match rows.  
2. **Explicit Join** (Modern & Preferred) ‚Üí Uses `JOIN` keyword.  

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Implicit Join (Old Style)**
This method does not use the `JOIN` keyword but instead lists multiple tables in the `FROM` clause and uses a `WHERE` condition to match records.

#### **Example: Implicit Join**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM EMPLOYEES, JOBS 
WHERE EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID = JOBS.JOB_ID;
```
‚úÖ This retrieves only matching records where `EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID` equals `JOBS.JOB_ID`.  

‚ùå **Downside:** Harder to read, can lead to mistakes, and doesn't support advanced joins like `LEFT JOIN`.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Explicit Join (Preferred)**
Explicit joins use the `JOIN` keyword, making queries more readable and flexible.

#### **Example: INNER JOIN (Equivalent to Implicit Join)**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM EMPLOYEES  
JOIN JOBS ON EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID = JOBS.JOB_ID;
```
‚úÖ **Easier to read and understand.**  
‚úÖ **More flexible for different join types.**

## **Types of Joins in SQL**
Now let‚Äôs look at different types of joins.

### **üîπ INNER JOIN (Only Matching Records)**
Retrieves only rows where there is a match in both tables.  
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEES.*, JOBS.JOB_TITLE 
FROM EMPLOYEES  
INNER JOIN JOBS ON EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID = JOBS.JOB_ID;
```
**üí° Example:**  
- If an employee has a `JOB_ID` that exists in the `JOBS` table, they are included.  
- If no matching job is found, they are excluded.

---

### **üîπ LEFT JOIN (All from Left Table, Matching from Right)**
Retrieves **all rows** from the **left table** (`EMPLOYEES`) and matching rows from `JOBS`. If no match is found, NULL is returned.  
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEES.*, JOBS.JOB_TITLE 
FROM EMPLOYEES  
LEFT JOIN JOBS ON EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID = JOBS.JOB_ID;
```
**üí° Example:**  
- If an employee has no job listed in `JOBS`, their `JOB_TITLE` will be **NULL** but they will still be included.

---

### **üîπ RIGHT JOIN (All from Right Table, Matching from Left)**
Retrieves **all rows** from the **right table** (`JOBS`) and matching rows from `EMPLOYEES`.  
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEES.*, JOBS.JOB_TITLE 
FROM EMPLOYEES  
RIGHT JOIN JOBS ON EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID = JOBS.JOB_ID;
```
**üí° Example:**  
- If there are jobs in `JOBS` that **no employee** has, they will still be included, but `EMPLOYEES.*` will be **NULL**.

---

### **üîπ FULL JOIN (All Records from Both)**
Retrieves **all rows** from both tables. If there‚Äôs no match, NULL is returned.
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEES.*, JOBS.JOB_TITLE 
FROM EMPLOYEES  
FULL JOIN JOBS ON EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID = JOBS.JOB_ID;
```
**üí° Example:**  
- Returns **all employees** and **all jobs**.  
- If an employee has no job ‚Üí `JOB_TITLE` is **NULL**.  
- If a job has no employees assigned ‚Üí Employee columns are **NULL**.

## **When to Use Implicit vs. Explicit Joins?**
| Feature | Implicit Join | Explicit Join |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Readability | ‚ùå Harder to read | ‚úÖ Easier to read |
| Performance | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly worse | ‚úÖ Optimized |
| Flexibility | ‚ùå Limited join types | ‚úÖ Supports all joins |
| Best Practice? | ‚ùå Avoid | ‚úÖ Use this |

---

## **Conclusion**
üîπ **Use explicit joins (`JOIN ON`)** for better readability and performance.  
üîπ **Implicit joins (`WHERE`)** are outdated and should be avoided in modern SQL.  
üîπ **Choose the right join (`INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL`)** depending on what data you need.
