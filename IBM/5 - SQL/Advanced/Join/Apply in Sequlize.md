Sure bro, here’s a quick breakdown of the different types of SQL `JOINs` and how they map to Sequelize:  

### 1️⃣ **INNER JOIN** (Default in Sequelize)  
✅ Returns only matching records from both tables.  

🔹 **Raw SQL:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users 
INNER JOIN Posts ON Users.id = Posts.userId;
```
🔹 **Sequelize:**  
```js
User.findAll({ include: Post });
```
**📌 Use Case:** When you only want users who have posts.  

---

### 2️⃣ **LEFT JOIN** (LEFT OUTER JOIN)  
✅ Returns all records from the left table + matching records from the right table. If no match, returns `NULL`.  

🔹 **Raw SQL:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users 
LEFT JOIN Posts ON Users.id = Posts.userId;
```
🔹 **Sequelize:**  
```js
User.findAll({ include: { model: Post, required: false } });
```
**📌 Use Case:** Get all users, even those without posts.  

---

### 3️⃣ **RIGHT JOIN** (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)  
✅ Opposite of LEFT JOIN. Returns all records from the right table + matching records from the left.  

🔹 **Raw SQL:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users 
RIGHT JOIN Posts ON Users.id = Posts.userId;
```
🔹 **Sequelize:** (Sequelize **does not support** `RIGHT JOIN`, but you can use raw SQL)  
```js
sequelize.query("SELECT * FROM Users RIGHT JOIN Posts ON Users.id = Posts.userId");
```
**📌 Use Case:** When you want all posts, even if they have no associated users.  

---

### 4️⃣ **FULL OUTER JOIN**  
✅ Returns all records from both tables. If no match, fills with `NULL`.  

🔹 **Raw SQL:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users 
FULL OUTER JOIN Posts ON Users.id = Posts.userId;
```
🔹 **Sequelize:** (Not directly supported, but you can use raw SQL)  
```js
sequelize.query("SELECT * FROM Users FULL OUTER JOIN Posts ON Users.id = Posts.userId");
```
**📌 Use Case:** When you want to get all users and all posts, even if they are not linked.  

---

### 5️⃣ **CROSS JOIN**  
✅ Cartesian product (combines every row of one table with every row of the other).  

🔹 **Raw SQL:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users 
CROSS JOIN Posts;
```
🔹 **Sequelize:** (Requires raw SQL)  
```js
sequelize.query("SELECT * FROM Users CROSS JOIN Posts");
```
**📌 Use Case:** If you need all possible combinations of two tables.  

---

### Summary  
| Join Type | Returns | Sequelize Equivalent |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| **INNER JOIN** | Only matching records | `include: Post` |
| **LEFT JOIN** | All left table records + matching right | `include: { model: Post, required: false }` |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | All right table records + matching left | ❌ (Raw SQL needed) |
| **FULL OUTER JOIN** | All records from both tables | ❌ (Raw SQL needed) |
| **CROSS JOIN** | All possible combinations | ❌ (Raw SQL needed) |
